# Retail-Leakage-and-Surplus-with-AI

The PDS (Public Distribution System) is a scheme by Gov of India to provide the poors with food grains at subsidy price. Even after decades of PDS being functional, India's Hunger Index is touching height. Meanwhile, at the other end Tonnes of grains are getting wasted at FCI warehouses.
The reason being fragmentated supply chain and vague predictons of grain's demand in each area. Some FCI godowns are over-allocated while some remains under-allocated with grains.

We are presenting the prototype of an AI based system to overcome this challenge. This portal is to be used by State level & Central level FCI officers to predict the areawise demand of grains for next 3 months. This will enable FCI to fix their supply chain & make PDS more effective.
